# Backup utility

This is designed specifically for me but could be adapted by others if interested. I use this simple utility to sync files back and forth to my network drive.

Usage:

```
./backup.sh [help] [--dry-run]
```

An interactive prompt will then determine what should be backed up and the direction of the sync, either from the local machine to the shared NAS drive or from the NAS drive to the machine.
